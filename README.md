# MyCounter

My Counter is an assignment from SideHustle to test for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. It has a counter minimum value of 0 and the maximum value of 50.
It is responsive on both mobile and desktop.
Upon click of the add count button, there is an increment in value by one and upon click of lower count there is a decrement in value by one.
There is also a My Code link which when clicked upon would direct you to github to view the code.
This project is available on my netlify account and hashnode blog.
